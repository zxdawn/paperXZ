\begin{abstract}
Lightning serves as the dominant source of nitrogen oxides (\chem{NO_\mathit{x} = NO + NO_2}) in the upper troposphere (UT), with a strong impact on ozone chemistry and the hydroxyl radical production.
However, the production efficiency (PE) of lightning nitrogen oxides (L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}}) is still quite uncertain (32--1100\,mol\,NO per flash).
Satellite measurements are a powerful tool to estimate L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} directly compared to conventional platforms.
To apply satellite data in both clean and polluted regions, a new algorithm for calculating L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} has been developed that uses the Berkeley High-Resolution (BEHR) v3.0B \chem{NO_2} retrieval algorithm and the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem).
L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE over the continental US is estimated using the \chem{NO_2} product of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) data and the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN) data.
Focusing on the summer season during 2014, we find that the lightning \chem{NO_2} (L\chem{NO_2}) PE is $32\pm 15$\,mol\,\chem{NO_2} per flash and $6\pm 3$\,mol\,\chem{NO_2} per stroke while L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE is $ 90 \pm 50$\,mol\,\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per flash and $17\pm 10$\,mol\,\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per stroke.
Results reveal that our method reduces the sensitivity to the background \chem{NO_2} and includes much of the below-cloud L\chem{NO_2}.
As the L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} parameterization varies in studies, the sensitivity of our calculations to the setting of the amount of lightning NO (LNO) is evaluated.
Careful consideration of the ratio of L\chem{NO_2} to \chem{NO_2} is also needed, given its large influence on the estimation of L\chem{NO_2} PE.

\introduction


Nitrogen oxides (\chem{NO_\mathit{x}}) near the Earth's surface are mainly produced by soil, biomass burning, and fossil fuel combustion, while \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} in the middle and upper troposphere originates largely from lightning and aircraft emissions.
\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} plays an important role in the production of ozone (\chem{O_3}) and the hydroxyl radical (OH).
While the anthropogenic sources of \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} are largely known, lightning nitrogen oxides (L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}}) are still the source with the greatest uncertainty, though they are estimated to range between 2 and
8\,Tg\,N\,yr$^{-1}$ \citep{Schumann.2007}.
L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} is produced in the upper troposphere (UT) by \chem{O_2} and \chem{N_2} dissociation in the hot lightning channel as described by the Zel'dovich mechanism \citep{Zeldovich.1967}.
With the recent updates of UT \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} chemistry, the daytime lifetime of UT \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} is evaluated to be $\sim 3$\,h near thunderstorms and $\sim 0.5$--1.5\,d away from thunderstorms \citep{Nault.2016,Nault.2017}.
This results in enhanced \chem{O_3} production in the cloud outflow of active convection \citep{Pickering.1996,Hauglustaine.2001,DeCaria.2005,Ott.2007,Dobber.2008,Allen.2010,Finney.2016}.
As \chem{O_3} is known as a greenhouse gas, strong oxidant, and absorber of ultraviolet radiation \citep{Myhre.2013}, the contributions of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} to \chem{O_3} production also have an effect on climate forcing.
\citet{Finney.2018} found different impacts on atmospheric composition and radiative forcing when simulating future lightning using a new upward cloud ice flux (IFLUX) method versus the commonly used cloud-top height (CTH) approach.
While global lightning is predicted to increase by 5\,{\%}--16\,{\%} over the next century with the CTH approach \citep{Clark.2017,Banerjee.2014,Krause.2014}, a 15\,{\%} decrease in global lightning was estimated with IFLUX in 2100 under a strong global warming scenario \citep{Finney.2018}.
As a result of the different effects on radiative forcing from ozone and methane, a net positive radiative forcing was found with the CTH approach while there is little net radiative forcing with the IFLUX approach \citep{Finney.2018}.
However, the convective available potential energy (CAPE) times the precipitation rate ($P$) proxy predicts a $12\pm 5$\,{\%} increase in the continental US (CONUS) lightning strike rate per kelvin of global warming \citep{Romps.2014}, while the IFLUX proxy predicts the lightning will only increase 3.4\,{\%}\,K$^{-1}$  over the CONUS.
Recently, \citet{Romps.2019} compared the CAPE $\times P$ proxy and IFLUX method in cloud-resolving models.
They reported that higher CAPE and updraft velocities caused by global warming could lead to the large increases in tropical lightning simulated by the CAPE $\times P$ proxy, while the IFLUX proxy predicts little change in tropical lightning because of the small changes in the mass flux of ice.

In view of the regionally dependent lifetime of \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} and the difficulty of measuring L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} directly, a better understanding of the L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production is required, especially in the tropical and midlatitude regions in summer.
Using its distinct spectral absorption lines in the near-ultraviolet (UV) and visible (VIS) ranges \citep{Platt.1983}, \chem{NO_2} can be measured by satellite instruments like the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment \citep[GOME;][]{Burrows.1999, Richter.2005}, SCanning Imaging Absorption SpectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY \citep[SCIAMACHY;][]{Bovensmann.1999}, the Second Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment \citep[GOME-2;][]{Callies.2000}, and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument \citep[OMI;][]{Levelt.2006}.
OMI has the highest spatial resolution, least instrument degradation, and longest record among these satellites \citep{Krotkov.2017}.
Satellite measurements of \chem{NO_2} are a powerful tool compared to conventional platforms because of their global coverage, constant instrument features, and temporal continuity.

Recent studies have determined and quantified L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} using satellite observations.
\citet{Beirle.2004} constrained the L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production to 2.8 (0.8--14)\,Tg\,N\,yr$^{-1}$ by combining GOME \chem{NO_2} data and flash counts from the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) aboard the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) over Australia.
\citet{Boersma.2005} estimated the global L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production of 1.1--6.4\,Tg\,N\,yr$^{-1}$ by comparing GOME \chem{NO_2} with distributions of L\chem{NO_2} modeled by Tracer Model 3 (TM3).
\citet{Martin.2007} analyzed SCIAMACHY \chem{NO_2} columns with Goddard Earth Observing System chemistry model (GEOS-Chem) simulations to identify L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production amounting to $6\pm 2$\,Tg\,N\,yr$^{-1}$.

As these methods focus on monthly or annual mean \chem{NO_2} column densities, more recent studies applied specific approaches to investigate L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} directly over active convection.
\citet{Beirle.2006} estimated L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} as 1.7 (0.6--4.7)\,Tg\,N\,yr$^{-1}$ based on a convective system over the Gulf of Mexico, using National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) observations and GOME \chem{NO_2} column densities.
However, it is assumed that all the enhanced \chem{NO_2} originated from lightning and did not consider the contribution of anthropogenic emissions.
\citet{Beirle.2010} analyzed L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production systematically using the global dataset of SCIAMACHY \chem{NO_2} observations combined with flash data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN).
Their analysis was restricted to 30\,km\,$\times$\,60\,km satellite pixels where the flash rate exceeded 1\,flash\,km$^{-2}$\,h$^{-1}$.
But they found L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production to be highly variable, and correlations between flash-rate densities and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production were low in some cases.
\citet{Bucsela.2010} estimated L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production as $\sim 100$--250\,mol\,\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per flash for four cases, using the DC-8 and OMI data during NASA's Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling Experiment (TC4).


Based on the approach used by \citet{Bucsela.2010}, a special algorithm was developed by \citet{Pickering.2016} to retrieve L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} from OMI and the WWLLN.
The algorithm takes the OMI tropospheric slant column density (SCD) of \chem{NO_2} (S$_\chem{NO_2}$) as the tropospheric slant column density of L\chem{NO_2} (S$_\chem{LNO_2}$) by using cloud radiance fraction (CRF) greater than 0.9 to minimize or screen the lower tropospheric background.
To convert the S$_\chem{LNO_2}$ to the tropospheric vertical column density (VCD) of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} (V$_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}$), an air mass factor (AMF) is calculated by dividing the a priori S$_\chem{LNO_2}$ by the a priori V$_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}$.
The a priori S$_\chem{LNO_2}$ is calculated using a radiative transfer model and a profile of L\chem{NO_2} simulated by the NASA Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) chemical transport model.
The a priori V$_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}$ is also obtained from the GMI model.
Results for the Gulf of Mexico during 2007--2011 summer yield L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production of $80\pm 45$\,mol\,\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per flash.
Since they considered \chem{NO_2} above the cloud to be L\chem{NO_2} in the algorithm due to the difficulty and uncertainty in determining the background \chem{NO_2}, their AMF and derived VCD of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} (L\chem{NO_2}) are named AMF$_{\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}\mathrm{Clean}}$ (AMF$_{\chem{LNO_2}\mathrm{Clean}}$) and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}}Clean (L\chem{NO_2}Clean), respectively.
Note that \citet{Pickering.2016} considered the two estimates of background derived from aircraft flights in the Gulf of Mexico region (3\,{\%} and 33\,{\%}) and subtracted the mean value (18\,{\%}) from the estimated mean L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production efficiency (PE) for the background bias.
However, we use the original algorithm directly without correction to distinguish the effect of different AMFs on L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} estimation in the remainder of this paper.
Unless otherwise specified, abbreviations S and V are respectively defined as the tropospheric SCD and VCD in this paper.

More recently \citet{Bucsela.2019} obtained an average PE of $180\pm 100$\,mol\,\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per flash over East Asia, Europe, and North America based on a modification of the method used in \citet{Pickering.2016}.
A power function between L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} and lightning flash rate was established, while the minimum flash-rate threshold was not applied.
The tropospheric \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} background was removed by subtracting the temporal average of \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} at each box where the value was weighted by the number of OMI pixels which meet the optical cloud pressure and CRF criteria required to be considered deep convection but have one flash or fewer instead.
The lofted pollution was considered to be 15\,{\%} of total \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} according to the estimation from \citet{DeCaria.2000,DeCaria.2005}, and the average chemical delay was adjusted by 15\,{\%} following the 3\,h L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} lifetime in the nearby field of convection \citep{Nault.2017}.
However, there were negative L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} values caused by the overestimation of the tropospheric background and stratospheric \chem{NO_2} at some locations.

On the other hand, \citet{Lapierre.2020} constrained L\chem{NO_2} to $1.1 \pm 0.2$\,mol\,\chem{NO_2} per stroke for intracloud (IC) strokes and $10.7 \pm 2.5$\,mol\,\chem{NO_2} per stroke for cloud-to-ground (CG) strokes over the CONUS.
L\chem{NO_2} per stroke was scaled to 24.2\,mol\,\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per flash using mean values of strokes per flash and the ratio of \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} to \chem{NO_2} in the UT.
They used the regridded Berkeley High-Resolution (BEHR) v3.0A $0.05{\degree} \times 0.05{\degree}$ ``visible only'' \chem{NO_2} VCD (V$_\mathrm{vis}$) product which includes two parts of \chem{NO_2} that can be ``seen'' by the satellite.
The first part is the \chem{NO_2} above clouds (pixels with CRF $> 0.9$) and the second part is the \chem{NO_2} detected from cloud-free areas.
A threshold of $3 \times 10^{15}$\,molecules\,cm$^{-2}$, the typical urban \chem{NO_2} concentration, was applied to mask the contaminated grid cells \citep{Beirle.2010,Laughner.2017}.
The main difference between \citet{Lapierre.2020} and \citet{Pickering.2016} is the air mass factor for lightning (AMF$_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}$) implemented in the basic algorithm.
In \citet{Lapierre.2020}, the air mass factor was used to convert S$_\chem{NO_2}$ to V$_\mathrm{vis}$, while in \citet{Pickering.2016} it was used to convert S$_\chem{LNO_2}$ to V$_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}$, assuming that all S$_\chem{NO_2}$ is generated by lightning.

To apply the approach used by \citet{Bucsela.2010}, \citet{Pickering.2016}, \citet{Bucsela.2019}, and \citet{Lapierre.2020} without geographic restrictions, the contamination by anthropogenic emissions must be taken into account in detail.
The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) has been employed to evaluate the convective transport and chemistry in many studies \citep{Barth.2012,Wong.2013,Fried.2016,Li.2017}.
Meanwhile, \citet{Laughner.2017} showed that the OMI AMF is increased by $\sim35\,{\%}$ for summertime when L\chem{NO_2} simulated by WRF-Chem is included in the a priori profiles to match aircraft observations.
The simulation agrees with observed \chem{NO_2} profiles and the bias of AMF related to these observations is reduced to $< \pm4$\,{\%} for OMI viewing geometries.

In this paper, we focus on the estimation of L\chem{NO_2} production per flash (L\chem{NO_2} per flash), L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production per flash (L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per flash), L\chem{NO_2} production per stroke (L\chem{NO_2} per stroke), and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production per stroke (L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per stroke) in May--August (MJJA) 2014 by developing an algorithm similar to that of \citet{Pickering.2016} based on the BEHR \chem{NO_2} retrieval algorithm \citep{Laughner.2018,Laughner.2019}, but it performs better over background \chem{NO_2} sources.
Section~\ref{section:DataandMethods} describes the satellite data, lightning data, model settings, and the algorithm in detail.
Section~\ref{section:Results} explores the suitable data criteria, compares different methods, and evaluates the effect of background \chem{NO_2}, cloud, and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} parameterization on L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production estimation.
Section~\ref{section:Uncertainties} examines the effect of different sources of the uncertainty on the results.
Conclusions are summarized in Sect.~\ref{section:conclusions}.

\section{Data and methods} \label{section:DataandMethods}

\subsection{Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)}

OMI is carried on the Aura satellite (launched in 2004), a member of the A-train satellite group \citep{Levelt.2006,Levelt.2018}. OMI passes over the Equator at $\sim 13$:45\,LT (ascending node) and has a swath width of 2600\,km, with a nadir field-of-view resolution of 13\,km\,$\times$\,24\,km.
Since the beginning of 2007, some of the measurements have become useless as a result of anomalous radiances called the ``row anomaly'' \citep{Dobber.2008,KNMI.2020}.
For the current study, we used the NASA standard product v3.0 \citep{Krotkov.2017} as input to the L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} retrieval algorithm.

The main steps of calculating the \chem{NO_2} tropospheric VCD (V$_\chem{NO_2}$) in the NASA product include the following.
\begin{enumerate}
\item SCDs are determined by the OMI-optimized differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) spectral fit.

\item A corrected (``de-striped'') SCD is obtained by subtracting the cross-track bias caused by an instrument artifact from the measured slant column.

\item The AMF for stratospheric (AMF$_\mathrm{strat}$) or tropospheric column (AMF$_\mathrm{trop}$) is calculated from the \chem{NO_2} profiles integrated vertically using weighted scattering weights with the a priori profiles. These profiles are obtained from GMI monthly mean profiles using 4 years (2004--2007) of simulation.

\item The stratospheric \chem{NO_2} VCD (V$_\mathrm{strat}$) is calculated from the subtraction of the a priori contribution from tropospheric \chem{NO_2} and a three-step (interpolation, filtering, and smoothing) algorithm  \citep{Bucsela.2013}.

\item V$_\mathrm{strat}$ is converted to the slant column using AMF$_\mathrm{strat}$ and subtracted from the measured SCDs to yield S$_\chem{NO_2}$, leading to V$_\chem{NO_2} =$ S$_\chem{NO_2}$/AMF$_\mathrm{trop}$.

Based on this method, we developed a new AMF$_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}$ to obtain the desired V$_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}$ (V$_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}} =$ S$_\chem{NO_2}$/AMF$_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}$) by replacing the original step. \item
Details of this algorithm are discussed in Sect.~\ref{section:AMF}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Earth Networks Total Lightning Detection Network (ENTLN)}
The Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN) operates a system of over 1500 ground-based stations around the world with more than 900 sensors installed in the CONUS \citep{Zhu.2017}.
Both IC and CG lightning flashes are located by the sensors with detection frequency ranging from 1\,Hz to 12\,MHz based on the electric field pulse polarity and wave shapes.
Groups of pulses are classified as a flash if they are within 700\,ms and 10\,km.
In the preprocessed data obtained from the ENTLN, both strokes and lightning flashes composed of one or more strokes are included.

\citet{Rudlosky.2015} compared ENTLN combined events (IC and CG) with LIS flashes and found that the relative flash detection efficiency of ENTLN over CONUS increases from 62.4\,{\%} during 2011 to 79.7\,{\%} during 2013.
\citet{Lapierre.2020} also compared combined ENTLN and the NLDN dataset with data from the LIS during 2014 and found the detection efficiencies of IC flashes and strokes to be 88\,{\%} and 45\,{\%}, respectively.
Since we only use the ENTLN data in 2014 as \citet{Lapierre.2020}, and NLDN detection efficiency of IC pulses should be lower than 33\,{\%}, which is calculated by the data in 2016 \citep{Zhu.2016}, only the IC flashes and strokes are divided by 0.88 and 0.45, respectively, while CG flashes and strokes are unchanged because of the high detection efficiency.

\subsection{Model description}
The present study uses WRF-Chem version 3.5.1 \citep{Grell.2005} with a horizontal grid size of 12\,km\,$\times$\,12\,km and 29 vertical levels (Fig.~\ref{fig:domain}).
The initial and boundary conditions of meteorological parameters are provided by the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset with a 3-hourly time resolution.
Based on \citet{Laughner.2019}, 3D wind fields, temperature, and water vapor are nudged towards the NARR data.
Outputs from version 4 of the Model for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers \citep[MOZART-4;][]{Emmons.2010} are used to generate the initial and boundary conditions of chemical species.
Anthropogenic emissions are driven by the 2011 National Emissions Inventory (NEI), scaled to model years by the Environmental Protection Agency annual total emissions \citep{EPA.2015}.
The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosol from Nature \citep[MEGAN;][]{Guenther.2006} is used for biogenic emissions.
The chemical mechanism is version 2 of the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism \citep[RACM2;][]{Goliff.2013} with updates from \citet{Browne.2014} and \citet{Schwantes.2015}.
In addition, lightning flash rate based on the level of neutral buoyancy parameterization \citep{Price.1992,Wong.2013} and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} parameterizations is activated (200\,mol\,NO per flash, the factor to adjust the predicted number of flashes is set to 1, hereinafter referred to as ``$1\times200$\,mol\,NO per flash'').
Simulated total flash densities are higher than ENTLN observations over the southeast US and lower than observations in the north-central US (Fig.~\ref{fig:TL}).
The impact of these biases on L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production is discussed and mitigated in Sect.~\ref{section:Criteria} and~\ref{section:Effectsofcloud}.
The bimodal profile modified from the standard \citet{Ott.2010} profile \citep{Laughner.2017} is employed as the vertical distribution of lightning NO (LNO) in WRF-Chem, while outputs of LNO and L\chem{NO_2} profiles are defined as the difference of vertical profiles between simulations with and without lightning.

\subsection{Method for deriving AMF} \label{section:AMF}
The V$_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}$ near convection is calculated according to
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{V}_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}} = \frac{\mathrm{S}_\chem{NO_2}}{\mathrm{AMF}_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}},
\end{equation}
where S$_\chem{NO_2}$ is the OMI-measured tropospheric slant column \chem{NO_2}, and AMF$_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}$ is a customized lightning air mass factor.
The concept of AMF$_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}$ was also used in \citet{Beirle.2009} to investigate the sensitivity of satellite instruments to freshly produced lightning \chem{NO_\mathit{x}}.
In order to estimate L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}}, we define the AMF$_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}$ as the ratio of the ``visible'' modeled \chem{NO_2} slant column to the total modeled tropospheric L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} vertical column (derived from the a priori NO and \chem{NO_2} profiles, scattering weights, and cloud radiance fraction):
\begin{equation} \label{AMFLNOx}
\mathrm{AMF}_{\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}} = \displaystyle{{(1-f_\mathrm{r}) \int_{p_\mathrm{surf}}^{p_\mathrm{tp}} w_\mathrm{clear}(p) \chem{NO_2}(p) \: \mathrm{d}p \atop + f_\mathrm{r} \int_{p_\mathrm{cloud}}^{p_\mathrm{tp}} w_\mathrm{cloudy}(p) \chem{NO_2}(p) \: \mathrm{d}p} \over{\int_{p_\mathrm{surf}}^{p_\mathrm{tp}} \chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}(p) \: \mathrm{d}p}},
\end{equation}
where $f_\mathrm{r}$ is the cloud radiance fraction (CRF), $p_\mathrm{surf}$ is the surface pressure, $p_\mathrm{tp}$ is the tropopause pressure, $p_\mathrm{cloud}$ is the cloud optical pressure (CP), $w_\mathrm{clear}$ and $w_\mathrm{cloudy}$ are respectively the pressure-dependent scattering weights from the TOMRAD lookup table \citep{Bucsela.2013} for clear and cloudy parts, and \chem{NO_2}$(p)$ is the modeled \chem{NO_2} vertical profile. Details of these standard parameters and calculation methods are given in \citet{Laughner.2018}.
L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}}$(p)$ is the L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} vertical profile calculated by the difference of vertical profiles between WRF-Chem simulations with and without lightning.

Please note that the CP is a reflectance-weighted pressure retrieved by the collision-induced \chem{O_2}--\chem{O_2} absorption band near 477\,nm \citep{Acarreta.2004,Sneep.2008,Stammes.2008}.
For a deep convective cloud with lightning, the CP lies below the geometrical cloud top, which is much closer to that detected by thermal infrared sensors, such as CloudSat and the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) \citep{Vasilkov.2008,Joiner.2012}.
Hence, much of the tropospheric \chem{NO_2} measured by OMI lies inside the cloud rather than above the cloud top.
In the following, ``above cloud'' or ``below cloud'' is relative to the cloud pressure detected by OMI.
The sensitivity study of \citet{Beirle.2009} compared the chemical composition from the cloud bottom to that of the cloud top and revealed that a significant fraction of the \chem{NO_2} within the cloud originating from lightning can be detected by the satellite.
This valuable cloud pressure concept has been applied not only in the L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} research but also in the cloud slicing method of deriving the UT \chem{O_3} and \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} \citep{Ziemke.2009,Ziemke.2017,Choi.2014,Strode.2017,Marais.2018}.
As discussed in \citet{Pickering.2016}, the ratio of V$_\chem{LNO_2}$ seen by OMI to V$_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}$ is partly influenced by $p_\mathrm{cloud}$.
The effects of LNO$_2$ below the cloud will be discussed in Sect.~\ref{section:Effectsofcloud}.

To compare our results with those of \citet{Pickering.2016} and \citet{Lapierre.2020}, we calculate their AMF$_{\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}\mathrm{Clean}}$ and AMF$_{\chem{NO_2}\mathrm{Vis}}$, respectively:

\end{equation}
A full definition list of the used AMFs is shown in Appendix~\ref{AppendixA}.

\subsection{Procedures for deriving L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}}} \label{section:Conditions}

V$_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}$ is re-gridded to $0.05{\degree}\times 0.05{\degree}$ grids using the constant value method \citep{Kuhlmann.2014}.
Then, it is analyzed in $1{\degree}\times 1{\degree}$ grid boxes with a minimum of 50 valid $0.05{\degree}\times 0.05{\degree}$ grids to minimize the noise.
The main procedures of deriving L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} are as follows.

CRFs (CRF~$\geq 70$\,{\%}, CRF~$\geq 90\,{\%}$, and CRF~$= 100\,{\%}$) and CP~$\leq 650$\,hPa are various criteria of deep convective clouds for OMI pixels \citep{Ziemke.2009,Choi.2014,Pickering.2016}.
The effect of different CRFs on the retrieved L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} is explored in Sect.~\ref{section:Comparison}.
Furthermore, another criterion of cloud fraction (CF) is applied to the WRF-Chem results for the successful simulation of convection.
The CF is defined as the maximum cloud fraction calculated by the Xu--Randall method between 350 and 400\,hPa \citep{Xu.1996,Strode.2017}.
This atmospheric layer (between 350 and 400\,hPa) avoids any biases in the simulation of high clouds.
We choose CF~$\geq 40\,{\%}$ suggested by \citet{Strode.2017} to determine cloudy or clear for each simulation grid.

Besides cloud properties, a time period and sufficient flashes (or strokes) are required for fresh L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} to be detected by OMI.
The time window ($t_\mathrm{window}$) is the hours prior to the OMI overpass time.
$t_\mathrm{window}$ is limited to 2.4\,h by the mean wind speed at pressure levels 500--100\,hPa during OMI overpass time and the square root of the $1{\degree}\times 1{\degree}$ box over the CONUS \citep{Lapierre.2020}.
Meanwhile, 2400\,flashes per box and 8160\,strokes per box per 2.4\,h time window are chosen as sufficient for detecting L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} \citep{Lapierre.2020}.
These criteria will result in a low bias in the PE results, as \citet{Bucsela.2019} found that the PE is larger at small flash rates, which are discarded here.
Since our study focuses on developing a new AMF and compares results with other works using similar lightning thresholds \citep{Lapierre.2020,Pickering.2016}, we will only discuss results based on the strict criteria in the main text.
For comparisons between the criterion of 2400 flashes per box and that of one flash per box, scatter diagrams using different lightning criteria are presented in Appendix~\ref{AppendixB}.

To ensure that lightning flashes are simulated successfully by WRF-Chem, the threshold of simulated total lightning flashes (TL) per box is set to 1000, which is fewer than that used by the ENTLN lightning observation, considering the uncertainty of lightning parameterization.
In view of other \chem{NO_2} sources in addition to L\chem{NO_2}, the ratio of modeled lightning \chem{NO_2} above cloud (L\chem{NO_2}Vis) to modeled \chem{NO_2} above cloud (\chem{NO_2}Vis) is defined to check whether enough L\chem{NO_2} can be detected by OMI.
The ratio $\geq 50$\,{\%} indicates that more than half of the \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} above the cloud must have an L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} source.

Finally, the \chem{NO_2} lifetime due to oxidation should be taken into account.
As estimated by \citet{Nault.2017}, the lifetime ($\tau$) of \chem{NO_2} in the near field of convections is $\sim$ 3\,h.
The initial value of \chem{NO_2} is solved by Eq.~(\ref{inition}) as
\begin{equation} \label{inition}
\chem{NO_2}(0) = \chem{NO_2}(\mathrm{OMI}) \times e^{0.5t/\tau},
\end{equation}
where \chem{NO_2(0)} is the moles of \chem{NO_2} emitted at time $t = 0$, \chem{NO_2}(OMI) is the moles of \chem{NO_2} measured at the OMI overpass time, and $0.5t$ is the half cross grid time, which is 1.2\,h, assuming that lightning occurred at the center of each $1{\degree}\times 1{\degree}$ box.
For each grid box, the mean L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} vertical column is obtained by averaging V$_\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}$ values from all regridded $0.05{\degree}\times 0.05{\degree}$ pixels in the box.
This mean value is converted to moles of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} using the dimensions of the grid box.
Two methods are applied to estimate the seasonal mean L\chem{NO_2} per flash, L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per flash, L\chem{NO_2} per stroke, and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per stroke:
\begin{enumerate}
\item summation method, dividing the sum of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} by the sum of flashes (or strokes) in each $1{\degree}\times 1{\degree}$ box in MJJA 2014;

\item linear regression method, applying the linear regression to daily mean values of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} and flashes (or strokes).
\end{enumerate}

    \label{table:conditions}
\end{table*}

A daily search of the \chem{NO_2} product for coincident ENTLN flash (stroke) data results in 99 (102) valid days under the CRF90\_ENTLN condition.
Taking the flash-type ENTLN data as an example, the number of valid days decreases from 99 to 81 under the CRF90\_ENTLN\_TL1000\_ratio50 condition, while L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per flash increases from $52.1\pm 51.1$ to $54.5\pm 48.1$\,mol per flash.
The result is almost the same as that under the CRF90\_ENTLN\_TL1000 condition, which is without the condition of more than half of the above-cloud \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} having an L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} source.
Although this indicates the criterion of TL works well, it is better to include the ratio criterion in case there are some exceptions in the different AMF methods.
Since CF $\geq 40$\,{\%} leads to a sharp loss of valid numbers and production, it is not a suitable criterion.
Instead the CRF criteria are used.
Finally, coincident ENTLN data, TL $\geq 1000$, and ratio $\geq 50$\,{\%} are chosen as the thresholds to explore the effects of three different CRF conditions (CRF~$\geq 70\,{\%}$, CRF $\geq 90$\,{\%}, and CRF~$= 100$\,{\%}) on L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production (Table~\ref{table:CRFs}).
Apart from the fewer valid days under higher CRF conditions (CRF~$\geq 90\,{\%}$ and CRF~$= 100$\,{\%}), L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per flash increases from $35.7 \pm 36.8$ to 54.5 $\pm$ 48.1\,mol per flash and decreases again to $20.8 \pm 37.4$\,mol per flash while L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per stroke enhances from $4.1  \pm 3.9 $ to $7.0\pm 4.8$\,mol per stroke and drops again to $2.6 \pm 4.0$\,mol per stroke (Table~\ref{table:CRFs}), as the CRF criterion increases from 70\,{\%} to 90\,{\%} and to 100\,{\%}.
When the CRF increases from 90\,{\%} to 100\,{\%}, the L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE decreases because of the higher lightning density with less L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} (not shown).
The increment of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE caused by the CRF increase from 70\,{\%} to 90\,{\%} is opposite to the result of \citet{Pickering.2016}.
This is an effect of the consideration of \chem{NO_2} contamination transported from the boundary layer in our method.
Although enhanced \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} is often observed in regions with CRF $> 70$\,{\%} \citep{Pickering.2016}, the following analysis will be based on the criterion of CRF~$\geq 90$\,{\%} considering the contamination by low and midlevel \chem{NO_2} and comparisons with the results of \citet{Pickering.2016} and \citet{Lapierre.2020}.

\subsection{Comparison of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production based on different AMFs} \label{section:Comparison}

\citet{Lapierre.2020} derived L\chem{NO_2} production based on the BEHR \chem{NO_2} product.
In order for our results to be comparable with those of \citet{Pickering.2016} and \citet{Lapierre.2020},
we choose \chem{NO_2} instead of \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} to derive production per flash (production efficiency, PE).
In Fig.~\ref{fig:t_series}, time series of \chem{NO_2}Vis, L\chem{NO_2}Vis, L\chem{NO_2}, and L\chem{NO_2}Clean production per day over CONUS are plotted for MJJA 2014 with the criterion of CRF~$\geq 90$\,{\%} and a flash threshold of 2400 flashes per 2.4\,h.
L\chem{NO_2} PEs are mostly in the range from 20 to 80\,mol per flash.
L\chem{NO_2}Vis PEs are smaller than L\chem{NO_2} PEs, which contain L\chem{NO_2} below clouds.
The simulation of GMI in \citet{Pickering.2016} indicated that 25\,{\%}--30\,{\%} of the L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} column lies below the CP, while the ratio in our WRF-Chem simulation is $56\pm 20$\,{\%}.
The effect of cloud properties on L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE will be discussed in more detail in Sect.~\ref{section:Effectsofcloud}.
Generally, the order of estimated daily PEs is L\chem{NO_2}Clean $>$ L\chem{NO_2} $>$ \chem{NO_2}Vis $>$ L\chem{NO_2}Vis.
The percent difference in the estimated PE ($\Delta$PE) between \chem{NO_2}Vis and L\chem{NO_2}Vis indicates a certain amount of background \chem{NO_2} exists above clouds.
Overall, the tendency of that $\Delta$PE is consistent with another $\Delta$PE between \chem{NO_2}Vis and L\chem{NO_2}Clean.
When the region is highly polluted ($\Delta$PE between \chem{NO_2}Vis and L\chem{NO_2}Vis is larger than 200\,{\%}), PEs based on \chem{NO_2}Vis and L\chem{NO_2}Clean are significantly overestimated.
In other words, \chem{NO_2}Vis and L\chem{NO_2}Clean are more sensitive to background \chem{NO_2}.
The extent of the overestimation of \chem{NO_2}Vis is larger than that of L\chem{NO_2}Clean in highly polluted regions, while it is usually opposite in most regions.

    \label{fig:t_series}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:PE_linear} shows the linear regression for ENTLN data versus \chem{NO_2}Vis, L\chem{NO_2}Vis, L\chem{NO_2}, and L\chem{NO_2}Clean with the same criteria as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:t_series}.
L\chem{NO_2}Clean PE (the largest slope) is $25.2 \pm 22.3$\,mol\,\chem{NO_2} per flash with a correlation of 0.25 and $2.3 \pm 2.1$\,mol\,\chem{NO_2} per stroke with a correlation of 0.22.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:t_series}, positive percent differences between \chem{NO_2}Vis PE and L\chem{NO_2}Clean PE occur much less often than negative differences.
As a result, \chem{NO_2}Vis PE ($17.1 \pm 17.2$\,mol\,\chem{NO_2} per flash and $0.4 \pm 1.0$\,mol\,\chem{NO_2} per stroke) is smaller than L\chem{NO_2}Clean PE using the linear regression method.

In order to compare our result with that of \citet{Lapierre.2020}, we tried to remove the CP~$\leq 650$\,hPa, TL~$\geq 1000$, and ratio~$\geq 50$\,{\%} conditions from criteria.
But, our result based on daily summed \chem{NO_2}Vis values ($3.8 \pm 0.5$ mol per stroke) is still larger than the value of $1.6 \pm$ 0.1\,mol per stroke mentioned in \citet{Lapierre.2020}.
This may be caused by the different version of the BEHR algorithm, as \citet{Lapierre.2020} used BEHR v3.0A and our algorithm is based on BEHR v3.0B \citep{Laughner.2019}.
The input of S$_\chem{NO_2}$ in both versions is from the NASA standard product v3, and the major improvements of BEHR v3.0B are listed below.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The profile (v3.0B) closest to the OMI overpass time was selected instead of the last profile (v3.0A) before the OMI overpass.

\item The AMF uses a variable tropopause height as opposed to the fixed 200\,hPa tropopause.

\item The surface pressure is now calculated according to \citet{Zhou.2009}.
\end{enumerate}
The detailed log of changes is available at \url{https://github.com/CohenBerkeleyLab/BEHR-core/blob/master/Documentation/Changelog.txt} (last access: 20~March~2020).
Note that \citet{Lapierre.2020} used the monthly \chem{NO_2} profile. While the daily profile is used in our study and the interval of our outputs from WRF-Chem is 30\,min, which is more frequent than 1\,h in the BEHR daily product,
the AMF could be affected by different \chem{NO_2} profiles.
In view of these factors, we compare different methods based on our data to minimize these effects.

Meanwhile, L\chem{NO_2} PE ($18.7 \pm 18.1$\,mol per flash and $2.1\pm 1.8$\,mol per stroke) is between L\chem{NO_2}Clean PE and \chem{NO_2}Vis PE, which coincides with the daily results in Fig.~\ref{fig:t_series}.
Furthermore, the L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE based on the linear regression of daily summed values,
the same method used in \citet{Pickering.2016},
is $114.8 \pm 18.2$\,mol per flash (or $17.8 \pm 2.9$\,mol per stroke), which is larger than 91\,mol per flash in \citet{Pickering.2016},
possibly due to the differences in geographic location, lightning data, and chemistry model.

The mean and standard deviation of L\chem{NO_2} PE under CRF~$\geq 90\,{\%}$ using the summation method is $46.2 \pm 35.1$\,mol per flash and $9.9 \pm 8.1$\,mol per stroke, while L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE is $125.6 \pm 95.9$\,mol per flash and $26.7 \pm 21.6$\,mol per stroke (Fig.~\ref{fig:PE_sum}).
The L\chem{NO_2} PE and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE are both higher in the southeast US (denoted by the red box in Fig.~5, 25--37{\degree}\,N, 75--95{\degree}\,W), consistent with \citet{Lapierre.2020} and \citet{Bucsela.2019}.
Compared with Fig.~\ref{fig:t_series}, Fig.~\ref{fig:delta}a and~b present some large differences between \chem{NO_2}Vis PE and L\chem{NO_2}Vis PE, which are consistent with what we expect for polluted regions.
Meanwhile, the differences between L\chem{NO_2} PE and \chem{NO_2}Vis PE depend on background \chem{NO_2}, the strength of updraft, and the profile.
The negative differences are caused by background \chem{NO_2} carried by the updraft while parts of the below-cloud L\chem{NO_2} result in L\chem{NO_2} PE higher than \chem{NO_2}Vis PE (Fig.~\ref{fig:delta}c).
Figure~\ref{fig:delta}d shows that the ratio of L\chem{NO_2}Vis to L\chem{NO_2} ranges from 10\,{\%} to 80\,{\%}.
This may be caused by the height of the clouds and the profile of L\chem{NO_2}.
If the CP is near 300\,hPa, the ratio should be smaller because of the coverage of clouds.
While peaks of the L\chem{NO_2} profile are below the CP, the ratio would also be smaller.
Therefore, a better understanding of the L\chem{NO_2} profile and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} below clouds is required.

\subsection{Effects of tropospheric background on L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production}
\label{section:Effectsofbackground}

With respect to the L\chem{NO_2} production, the patterns in Fig.~\ref{fig:delta} indicate the improvement of our approach is different in polluted and clean regions.
To simplify the quantification, we select six grids with similar \chem{NO_2} profiles ($\sim 100$\,pptv) above the cloud with CRF~$= 100$\,{\%}.
These grid boxes contain the polluted and clean cities denoted by stars and triangles in Fig.~\ref{fig:delta}a, respectively.
Then, the differences between AMFs are dependent on fewer parameters.
\begin{gather} \label{AMFLNO2_crf100}
\mathrm{AMF}_{\chem{LNO_2}} = \frac{\int_{p_\mathrm{cloud}}^{p_\mathrm{tp}} w_\mathrm{cloudy}(p) \chem{NO_2}(p) \: \mathrm{d}p}{\int_{p_\mathrm{surf}}^{p_\mathrm{tp}} \chem{LNO_2}(p) \: \mathrm{d}p}
\\
 \label{AMFNO2Vis_crf100}
\mathrm{AMF}_{\chem{NO_2}\mathrm{Vis}} = \frac{\int_{p_\mathrm{cloud}}^{p_\mathrm{tp}} w_\mathrm{cloudy}(p) \chem{NO_2}(p) \: \mathrm{d}p}{\int_{p_\mathrm{cld}}^{p_\mathrm{tp}} \chem{NO_2}(p) \: \mathrm{d}p}
\\ \label{AMFLNO2Clean_crf100}
\mathrm{AMF}_{\chem{LNO_2}\mathrm{Clean}} = \frac{\int_{p_\mathrm{cloud}}^{p_\mathrm{tp}} w_\mathrm{cloudy}(p) \chem{LNO_2}(p) \: \mathrm{d}p}{\int_{p_\mathrm{surf}}^{p_\mathrm{tp}} \chem{LNO_2}(p) \: \mathrm{d}p}
\end{gather}
Figure~\ref{fig:backgroundcomparisons} compares the mean profiles of \chem{NO_2}, background \chem{NO_2} and background \chem{NO_2} ratio in polluted and clean grids.
Generally, the profiles of the ratio of background \chem{NO_2} to total \chem{NO_2} are C shaped because UT L\chem{NO_2} concentrations are higher than UT background \chem{NO_2} concentrations.
However, the ratio profile in Fig.~\ref{fig:backgroundcomparisons}e has one peak between the cloud pressure and tropopause as background \chem{NO_2} increases and L\chem{NO_2} decreases.
Besides, the percentage of UT background \chem{NO_2} in polluted regions is steady and higher than that in clean regions.

Table~\ref{table:productioncomparisons} presents the relative changes among three methods in six cities.
The difference between AMF$_{\chem{LNO_2}}$ (Eq.~\ref{AMFLNO2_crf100}) and AMF$_{\chem{LNO_2}\mathrm{Clean}}$ (Eq.~\ref{AMFLNO2Clean_crf100}) is the numerator: $\int_{p_\mathrm{cloud}}^{p_\mathrm{tp}} w_\mathrm{cloudy}(p) \chem{NO_2}(p) \: \mathrm{d}p$ and $\int_{p_\mathrm{cloud}}^{p_\mathrm{tp}} w_\mathrm{ cloudy}(p) \chem{LNO_2}(p) \: \mathrm{d}p$.
When the ratio of L\chem{NO_2} is higher or the region is cleaner, the relative difference is smaller (e.g. 5.0\,{\%}--12.0\,{\%}, Fig.~\ref{fig:backgroundcomparisons}d--f).
The largest relative difference (46.3\,{\%}) occurs when the ratio of background \chem{NO_2} is continuously high in the UT (Fig.~\ref{fig:backgroundcomparisons}c).
As a result, our approach is less sensitive to background \chem{NO_2} and more suitable for convective cases over polluted locations.
In contrast, production estimated by our method is larger than that based on \chem{NO_2}Vis due to the L\chem{NO_2} below the cloud.
When the cloud is higher, in particular the peak of the LNO profile is lower than the cloud (Fig.~\ref{fig:backgroundcomparisons}b). The relative difference is larger (121.2\,{\%}) because more L\chem{NO_2} can not be included in the \chem{NO_2}Vis, which has been discussed in Sect.~\ref{section:Comparison}.
The relative change between AMF$_{\chem{LNO_2}\mathrm{Clean}}$ (Eq.~\ref{AMFLNO2Clean_crf100}) and AMF$_{\chem{NO_2}\mathrm{Vis}}$ (Eq.~\ref{AMFNO2Vis_crf100}) depends on $\int_{p_\mathrm{cloud}}^{p_\mathrm{tp}} w_\mathrm{cloudy}(p) \chem{LNO_2}(p) \: \mathrm{d}p / \int_{p_\mathrm{surf}}^{p_\mathrm{tp}} w_\mathrm{cloudy}(p) \chem{LNO_2}(p) \: \mathrm{d}p$, which is also affected by cloud, not the background \chem{NO_2}.
The largest relative change (153.8\,{\%}) occurs at New Orleans, which has the lowest cloud pressure and consequently the smallest visible column.

\subsection{Effects of cloud and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} parameterization on L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production} \label{section:Effectsofcloud}

Figure~\ref{fig:CP_ratio_LNO2}a presents the daily distribution of CP and the ratio of L\chem{NO_2}Vis to L\chem{NO_2} during MJJA 2014 with the criteria defined in Sect.~\ref{section:Criteria} under CRF~$\geq 90$\,{\%}.
Since the ratio of L\chem{NO_2}Vis to L\chem{NO_2} decreases from 0.8 to 0.2 as the cloud pressure decreases from 600 to 300\,hPa, \chem{NO_2}Vis PE is smaller than L\chem{NO_2} PE in relatively clean areas as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PE_linear}.
Apart from L\chem{NO_2}Vis, the L\chem{NO_2} PE is also affected by CP.
For L\chem{NO_2} PEs larger than 30\,mol per stroke, the CPs are all smaller than 550\,hPa (Fig.~\ref{fig:CP_ratio_LNO2}b).
However, smaller L\chem{NO_2} PEs ($< 30$\,mol per stroke) occur on all levels between 650 and 200\,hPa.
Because of the limited number of large L\chem{NO_2} PEs and lightning data, we cannot derive the relationship between L\chem{NO_2} PE and cloud pressure or other lightning properties at this stage.
Because the CP only represents the development of clouds, the vertical structure of flashes can not be derived from the CP values only.
As discussed in several previous studies, the flash channel length varies and depends on the environmental conditions \citep{Carey.2016,Mecikalski.2017,Fuchs.2018}.
\citet{Davis.2019} compared two kinds of flash: normal flashes and anomalous flashes.
Because updrafts are stronger and flash rates are higher in anomalous storms, UT L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} concentrations are larger in anomalous than normal polarity storms.
In general, normal flashes are coupled with an upper-level positive charge region and a midlevel negative charge region, while anomalous flashes are opposite \citep{Williams.1989}.
It is not straightforward to estimate the error resulting from the vertical distribution of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}}.
There are mainly two methods of distributing L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} in models: L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} profiles (postconvection) in which L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} has already been redistributed by convective transport and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production profiles (preconvection) made before the redistribution of convective transport \citep{Allen.2012,Luo.2017}.
However, given the similarity of results compared to other L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} studies, we believe that our $1{\degree}\times 1{\degree}$ results based on postconvective L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} profiles are sufficient for estimating average L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production.

\end{table*}

The LNO production settings in WRF-Chem varied in different studies.
\citet{Zhao.2009} set a \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production rate of 250\,mol\,NO per flash in a regional-scale model, while \citet{Bela.2016} chose 330\,mol\,NO per flash used by \citet{Barth.2012}.
\citet{Wang.2015} assumed approximately 500\,mol\,NO per flash, which was derived by a cloud-scale chemical transport model and in-cloud aircraft observations \citep{Ott.2010}.
To illustrate the impact of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} parameterization on L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} estimation, we apply another WRF-Chem \chem{NO_2} profile setting ($2\times$~base flash rate, 500\,mol\,NO per flash, hereinafter referred to as ``$2\times500$\,mol\,NO per flash'') to a priori profiles and evaluate the changes in AMF$_{\chem{LNO_2}}$, AMF$_{\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}}$, L\chem{NO_2} PE, and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE.
For the linear regression method (Fig.~\ref{fig:PE_linear_2x500}), L\chem{NO_2} PE is $29.8 \pm 20.5$\,mol per flash, which is 59.4\,{\%} larger than the basic one ($18.7 \pm 18.1$\,mol per flash).
Meanwhile, L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE (increasing from $54.5 \pm 48.1$\,mol per flash to $88.5 \pm 61.1$\,mol per flash) also depends on the configuration of LNO production in WRF-Chem.
The comparison between Figs.~\ref{fig:PE_linear} and~\ref{fig:PE_linear_2x500} shows that L\chem{NO_2}Clean PE and L\chem{NO_2} PE are more similar while L\chem{NO_2} PE and \chem{NO_2}Vis PE present the same tendency.
It remains unclear as to whether the NO--\chem{NO_2}--\chem{O_3} cycle or other L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} reservoirs account for the increment of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE.
This would need detailed source analysis in WRF-Chem and is beyond the scope of this study.

Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_diff} shows the average percentage changes in AMF$_{\chem{LNO_2}}$, AMF$_{\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}}$, L\chem{NO_2}, and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} between retrievals using profiles based on $1\times200$ and $2\times500$\,mol\,NO per flash.
These results were obtained by averaging data over MJJA 2014 based on the method described in Sect.~\ref{section:Conditions} with the criterion of CRF~$\geq 90\,{\%}$.
The effects on L\chem{NO_2} and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} retrieval from increasing LNO profile values show mostly the same tendency: smaller AMF$_{\chem{LNO_2}}$ and AMF$_{\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}}$ lead to larger L\chem{NO_2} and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}}, but the changes are regionally dependent.
This is caused by the nonlinear calculation of AMF$_{\chem{LNO_2}}$ and AMF$_{\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}}$.
As the contribution of L\chem{NO_2} increases, both the numerator and denominator of Eq.~(\ref{AMFLNOx}) increase.
Note that the L\chem{NO_2} accounts for a fraction of \chem{NO_2} above the clouds. The magnitude of an increasing denominator could be different than that of an increasing numerator, resulting in a different effect on the AMF$_{\chem{LNO_2}}$ and AMF$_{\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}}$.
As mentioned in \citet{Zhu.2019}, the lightning densities in the southeast US might be overestimated using the $2\times500$\,mol\,NO per flash setting and the same lightning parameterization as ours.
Fortunately, the AMFs and estimated L\chem{NO_2} change little in that region.
Because the southeast US has the highest flash density (Fig.~\ref{fig:TL}), the \chem{NO_2} in the numerator of AMF is dominated by L\chem{NO_2}.
Both the SCD and VCD will increase when the model uses higher L\chem{NO_2}.
In other words, the sensitivity to the LNO setting decreases and the relative distribution of L\chem{NO_2} matters.

Figure~\ref{fig:distribution} shows the comparison of the mean LNO and L\chem{NO_2} profiles in two specific regions where the $2\times500$\,mol\,NO per flash setting leads to lower and higher L\chem{NO_2} PEs, respectively.
The first one (Fig.~\ref{fig:distribution}a) is the region (36--37{\degree}\,N, 89--90{\degree}\,W) containing the minimal negative percent change in L\chem{NO_2} (Fig.~\ref{fig:simulation_diff}c).
The second one (31--32{\degree}\,N, 97--98{\degree}\,W), Fig.~\ref{fig:distribution}b, has the largest positive percent change in L\chem{NO_2} (Fig.~\ref{fig:simulation_diff}c).
Although the relative distributions of mean LNO and L\chem{NO_2} profiles are similar in both regions, the magnitude differs by a factor of 10.
This phenomenon implies that the performance of lightning parameterization in WRF-Chem is regionally dependent, and an unrealistic profile could appear in the UT.
Although this sensitivity analysis is false in some regions, it allows the calculation of an upper limit on the \chem{NO_2} due to LNO and L\chem{NO_2} profiles.
As discussed in \citet{Laughner.2017}, the scattering weights are uniform under cloudy conditions and the sensitivity of \chem{NO_2} is nearly constant with different pressure levels because of the high albedo.
However, the relative distribution of L\chem{NO_2} within the UT should be taken carefully into consideration.
If the L\chem{NO_2/NO_2} above the cloud is large enough (Fig.~\ref{fig:distribution}a), the AMF$_{\chem{LNO_2}}$ is largely determined by the ratio of L\chem{NO_2}Vis to L\chem{NO_2}, which is related to the relative distribution.
When the condition of high \chem{LNO_2/NO_2} is not met, both relative distribution and ratio are important (Fig.~\ref{fig:distribution}b).

    Differences between profiles are generated by $2\times500$ and $1\times200$\,mol\,NO per flash.}
    \label{fig:simulation_diff}
\end{figure*}
To clarify this, we applied the same sensitivity test of different simulating LNO amounts for all four methods mentioned in Sect.~\ref{section:AMF}: L\chem{NO_2}, L\chem{NO_2}Vis, L\chem{NO_2}Clean, and \chem{NO_2}Vis (Fig.~\ref{fig:diff_crf100}).
Note that the threshold for CRF is set to 100\,{\%} to simplify Eq.~(\ref{AMFLNOx}) to Eq.~(\ref{AMFLNO2_crf100}).
The overall differences of L\chem{NO_2}Clean and \chem{NO_2}Vis are smaller than those of L\chem{NO_2} and L\chem{NO_2}Vis.
Comparing the numerator and denominator in the equations, it is clear why the impact of different simulating LNO amounts is smaller in Fig.~\ref{fig:diff_crf100}c and~d.
For L\chem{NO_2}Clean and \chem{NO_2}Vis, both the SCD and VCD will increase (decrease) when more (less) L\chem{NO_2} or \chem{NO_2} presents.
The difference between Fig.~\ref{fig:diff_crf100}a and~b is the denominator: the total tropospheric L\chem{NO_2} vertical column and visible L\chem{NO_2} vertical column, respectively.
As a result, the negative values in Fig.~\ref{fig:diff_crf100}a are caused by the part of L\chem{NO_2} below the cloud.
The uncertainty of retrieved L\chem{NO_2} and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PEs is driven by this error, and we conservatively estimate this to be $\pm 13$\,{\%} and $\pm 25$\,{\%}, respectively.

\section{Uncertainty analysis} \label{section:Uncertainties}

The uncertainties of the L\chem{NO_2} and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PEs are estimated following \citet{Pickering.2016}, \citet{Allen.2019}, \citet{Bucsela.2019}, \citet{Laughner.2019}
and \citet{Lapierre.2020}.
We determine the uncertainty due to BEHR tropopause pressure, cloud radiance fraction, cloud pressure, surface pressure, surface reflectivity, profile shape, profile location, V$_\mathrm{strat}$, the detection efficiency of lightning, $t_\mathrm{window}$, and L\chem{NO_2} lifetime numerically by perturbing each parameter in turn and re-retrieving the L\chem{NO_2} and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} with the perturbed values (Table~\ref{table:Uncertainties}).

The GEOS-5 monthly tropopause pressure, which is consistent with the NASA standard product, is applied instead of the variable WRF tropopause height to evaluate the uncertainty (6\,{\%} for L\chem{NO_2} PE and 4\,{\%} for L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE) caused by the BEHR tropopause pressure.
The cloud pressure bias is given as a function of cloud pressure and fraction by \citet{Acarreta.2004}, implying an uncertainty of 32\,{\%}, the most likely uncertainty in the production analysis, for L\chem{NO_2} PE and 34\,{\%} for L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE.
The resolution of GLOBE terrain height data is much higher than the OMI pixel, and a fixed scale height is assumed in the BEHR algorithm.
As a result, \citet{Laughner.2019}
compared the average WRF surface pressures to the GLOBE surface pressures and arrived at the largest bias of 1.5\,{\%}.
Based on the largest bias, we vary the surface pressure (limited to less than 1020\,hPa), and the uncertainty can be neglected.

The error in cloud radiance fraction is transformed from cloud fraction using
\begin{equation}
\sigma = 0.05 \cdot \left.\frac{\partial{f_\mathrm{r}}}{\partial{f_\mathrm{g}}}\right|_{f_\mathrm{g,pix}},
\end{equation}
where $f_\mathrm{r}$ is the cloud radiance fraction, $f_\mathrm{g}$ is the cloud fraction, and $f_\mathrm{g,pix}$ is the cloud fraction of a specific pixel.
We calculate $\partial{f_\mathrm{r}}/\partial{f_\mathrm{g}}$ under $f_\mathrm{g,pix}$ by the relationship between all binned $f_\mathrm{r}$ and $f_\mathrm{g}$ with the increment of 0.05 for the each specific OMI orbit.
Considering the relationship, the error in cloud fraction is converted to an error in cloud radiance fraction of 2\,{\%} for the L\chem{NO_2} and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PEs.

The accuracy of the 500\,m MODIS albedo product is usually within 5\,{\%} of albedo observations at the validation sites, and those exceptions with low-quality flags have been found to be primarily within 10\,{\%} of the field data \citep{Schaaf.2011}.
Since we use the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data directly, rather than including a radiative transfer model, 14\,{\%} Lambertian equivalent reflectivity (LER) error and 10\,{\%} uncertainty are combined to get a perturbation of 17\,{\%} \citep{Laughner.2019}.
The uncertainty due to surface reflectivity can be neglected with the 17\,{\%} perturbation.

As discussed at the end of Sect.~\ref{section:Effectsofcloud}, another setting of L\chem{NO_2} ($2\times500$\,mol\,NO per flash) is applied to determine the uncertainty of the lightning parameterization and the vertical distribution of LNO in WRF-Chem.
Differences between the two profiles lead to an uncertainty of 13\,{\%} and 25\,{\%} in the resulting PEs of L\chem{NO_2} and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}}.
Another sensitivity test allows each pixel to shift by $-0.2$, 0, or $+0.2$\,{\degree} in the directions of longitude and latitude, taking advantage of the high-resolution profile location in WRF-Chem.
The resulting uncertainty of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE is 1\,{\%}, including the error of transport and chemistry by shifting pixels.

Compared to the NASA standard product v2, \citet{Krotkov.2017} demonstrated that the noise in V$_\mathrm{strat}$ is $1 \times 10^{14}$\,cm$^{-2}$.
Errors in polluted regions can be slightly larger than this value, while errors in the cleanest areas are typically significantly smaller \citep{Bucsela.2013}.
We estimated the uncertainty of the V$_\mathrm{strat}$ component and the slant column errors to be 10\,{\%} and 5\,{\%}, respectively, following \citet{Allen.2019}.

Based on the standard deviation of the detection efficiency estimation over the CONUS relative to LIS, ENTLN detection efficiency uncertainties are $\pm$ 16\,{\%} for total and IC flashes and strokes.
Due to the high detection efficiency of CG over the CONUS, the uncertainty is estimated to be $\pm 5$\,{\%} \citep{Lapierre.2020}.
It is found that the resulting uncertainty of detection efficiency is 15\,{\%} in the production analysis.
We have used the $t_\mathrm{window}$ of 2.4\,h for counting ENTLN flashes and strokes to analyze L\chem{NO_2} and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production.
Because $t_\mathrm{window}$ derived from the ERA5 reanalysis can not represent the variable wind speeds, a sensitivity test is performed which yields an uncertainty of 10\,{\%} for production per flash and 8\,{\%} for production per stroke using $t_\mathrm{window}$ of 2 and 4\,h.
Meanwhile, the lifetime of UT \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} ranges from 2 to 12\,h depending on the convective location, the methyl peroxy nitrate and alkyl, and multifunctional nitrates \citep{Nault.2017}.
The lifetime ($\tau$) of \chem{NO_2} in Eq.~(\ref{inition}) is replaced by 2 and 12\,h to determine the uncertainty as 24\,{\%} due to lifetime.
This is comparable with the uncertainty (25\,{\%}) caused by lightning parameterization for the L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} type.

Recent studies revealed that the modeled \chem{NO/NO_2} ratio departs from the data in the SEAC$^{4}$RS aircraft campaign \citep{Travis.2016,Silvern.2018}.
\citet{Silvern.2018} attributed this to the positive interference on the \chem{NO_2} measurements or errors in the cold-temperature \chem{NO-NO_2-O_3} photochemical reaction rate.
We assign a 20\,{\%} bias with $\pm 15$\,{\%} uncertainty to this error considering the possible positive \chem{NO_2} measurement interferences \citep{Allen.2019,Bucsela.2019} and estimate the uncertainty to be 15\,{\%} for L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE.

In addition, the estimation of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE also depends on the tropospheric background \chem{NO_2}.
In our method, the main factors affecting this factor are the emissions inventory and the amount of transported \chem{NO_2}.
For the emissions inventory, the sources of uncertainty are assumptions, methods, input data, and calculation errors.
As a result, the uncertainties for different species or pollutants related to \chem{NO_2} are different and the U.S. EPA also does not publish the quantified uncertainty measures because the parties that submit emissions estimates to the U.S. EPA are not asked to include quantitative uncertainty measurements or estimates \citep{us20152011}.
For the simulated convective transport, \citet{Li.2018} compared the cloud-resolving simulations with these based on convective parameterization and pointed out that the convective transport was weaker in the parameterization.
But, we believe that the ratio condition (L\chem{NO_2}Vis/\chem{NO_2}Vis $\geq 50$\,{\%}) should reduce these two kinds of uncertainty, and we assume an uncertainty of 10\,{\%}, which is less than the 20\,{\%} assigned in \citet{Allen.2019} and \citet{Bucsela.2019}.

The overall uncertainty is estimated as the square root of the sum of the squares of all individual uncertainties in Table~\ref{table:Uncertainties}.
The net uncertainty is 48\,{\%} and 56\,{\%} for the L\chem{NO_2} type and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} type, respectively.
The mean L\chem{NO_2} per flash, L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per flash, L\chem{NO_2} per stroke, and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per stroke based on the linear regression and summation method are 32\,mol per flash, 90\,mol per flash, 6\,mol per stroke, and 17\,mol per stroke.
Applying the corresponding uncertainty to these mean values, we arrive at $32 \pm 15$\,mol L\chem{NO_2} per flash, $90 \pm 50$\,mol L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per flash, $6 \pm 3$\,mol L\chem{NO_2} per stroke, and $17 \pm 10$\,mol L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per stroke.
This is in the range of current literature estimates ranging from 33 to 500\,mol L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per flash \citep{Schumann.2007,Beirle.2010,Bucsela.2010}.
\citet{Bucsela.2010} estimated L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE of 100--250\,mol per flash, which is higher than but overlaps with our estimate.
\citet{Pickering.2016} estimated L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} PE to be $80 \pm 45$\,mol per flash for the Gulf of Mexico.
This is 50\,{\%} smaller than our flash-based results over the CONUS, if we use the same linear regression method which is based on the daily summed values instead of daily mean values.
Note that the criteria defined in Sect.~\ref{section:Criteria} lead to many missing data over the Gulf of Mexico; thus it is actually a comparison between different regions.
For the stroke-based results, \citet{Lapierre.2020} found lower L\chem{NO_2} PE of $1.6 \pm 0.1$\,mol per stroke, and the difference is caused by the different version of BEHR algorithm and several settings as mentioned in Sect.~\ref{section:Comparison}.
\citet{Bucsela.2019} inferred an average value of $200 \pm 110$\,mol (122\,{\%} larger than our results) of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} produced per flash over the North America, this is related to the different algorithm, lightning data, and lightning thresholds.

\conclusions \label{section:conclusions}

In this study, a new algorithm for retrieving L\chem{NO_2} (L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}}) from OMI, including L\chem{NO_2} (L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}}) below cloud, has been developed for application over active convection.
It works in both clean and polluted regions because of the consideration of tropospheric background pollution in the definition of AMFs.
It uses specific criteria combined with several other conditions (sufficient CRF, coincident ENTLN data, TL~$\geq 1000$, and ratio $\geq 50$\,{\%}) to ensure that the electrically active regions are detected by OMI and simulated by WRF-Chem successfully.
We conducted an analysis on $1{\degree} \times 1{\degree}$ daily boxes in MJJA 2014 and obtained the seasonal mean L\chem{NO_2} and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production efficiencies over the CONUS.
Considering all the uncertainties (Table~\ref{table:Uncertainties}) and applying the summation and regression methods, the final mean production efficiencies are estimated to be $32 \pm 15$\,mol L\chem{NO_2} per flash, $90 \pm 50$\,mol L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per flash, $6 \pm 3$\,mol L\chem{NO_2} per stroke, and $17 \pm 10$\,mol L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per stroke.

Compared with \citet{Lapierre.2020}, we find that the L\chem{NO_2} production could be larger when the below-cloud L\chem{NO_2} is taken into account, especially for the high clouds.
Meanwhile, if the method of \citet{Pickering.2016} is applied without the background \chem{NO_2} correction, the derived L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production efficiency is similar to ours in clean regions or regions with a high L\chem{NO_2} concentration above the cloud, but it could be overestimated by more than 18\,{\%} in polluted regions.
Finally, implementing profiles generated with different model settings of lightning ($1\times200$ and $2\times500$\,mol\,NO per flash), we find that the larger LNO production setting leads to 62\,{\%} larger retrieval of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} on average despite some regionally dependent effects caused by the nonlinear calculation of AMF.
Both the ratio of the tropospheric L\chem{NO_2} above the cloud to the total tropospheric L\chem{NO_2} and the ratio of L\chem{NO_2} to \chem{NO_2} cause different comprehensive effects due to the nonlinear calculation of AMF$_{\chem{LNO_2}}$ and AMF$_{\chem{LNO_\mathit{x}}}$.


\hack{\newpage}
Since other regions, like China and India, have much more \chem{NO_2} pollution than the CONUS, it is necessary to consider the background \chem{NO_2} in detail.
These analyses will be complemented by the recently launched satellite instrument (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument, TROPOMI) \citep{Veefkind.2012,Boersma.2018,Griffin.2019} and Lightning Mapping Imager (LMI) on the new-generation Chinese geostationary meteorological satellite Fengyun-4 \citep{Min.2017,Yang.2017,Zhang.2019}.
Future work investigating the flash channel length and more detailed lightning parameterization in WRF-Chem would greatly benefit L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} estimation.
Applying current methods in future studies may enhance the accuracy of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production at both local and global scales.

\section{L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} production based on lower lightning thresholds} \label{AppendixB}
While we used 2400 flashes per box and 8160 strokes per box per 2.4\,h time window for detecting L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}}, here we show results obtained when using one flash per box and 3.4 strokes per box in the same time window.
We note that the WRF total lightning threshold is also reduced to one flash per box, but we keep the ratio condition unchanged.
Briefly, the condition is CRF90\_ENTLN1(3.4)\_TL1\_ratio50 as shown in Table~\ref{table:Abbreviations}.

Similarly, the order of estimated daily PEs is L\chem{NO_2}Clean $>$ L\chem{NO_2} $>$ \chem{NO_2}Vis $>$ L\chem{NO_2}Vis (Fig.~\ref{fig:PE_linear_fewerflash}).
Compared with Fig.~\ref{fig:PE_linear}, the L\chem{NO_2} per flash and L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per flash are larger while PEs based on stroke data are smaller.
Considering the additional boxes of fewer lightning counts, differences in the daily mean flashes and \chem{NO_\mathit{x}} result in different PEs, and the relationship presents more like the power function as mentioned in \citet{Bucsela.2019}.

Instead of using the nonlinear regression of power function
  \begin{equation} \label{power_function}
    y = \alpha x^{\beta},
  \end{equation}
  where $x$ is flashes or strokes and $y$ is \chem{NO_2} or \chem{NO_\mathit{x}},
  we take the logarithm of both sides and apply the linear regression to data:
  \begin{equation} \label{logarithm}
    \log_{10}y = \log_{10}{\alpha} + \beta \log_{10}{x}.
  \end{equation}
As expected, the linear regression based on logarithmized data performs better in this situation and yields $\alpha = 38$\,kmol and $\beta = 0.3$ for L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}} per flash (Fig.~\ref{fig:PE_power_fewerflash}).
Since we use the unbinned data (flashes not divided into many groups), we compare our results with \citet{Bucsela.2019} based on the same kind of data ($\alpha = 10.3$\,kmol and $\beta = 0.42$).
The large difference of $\alpha$ is related to the method of estimating L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}}, different lightning data (WWLLN and ENTLN), and different regions (northern midlatitudes and CONUS).
Note that the resolution (13\,km\,$\times$\,24\,km) of OMI could weaken the signal of L\chem{NO_\mathit{x}}.
We believe the phenomenon of higher production efficiency as flash rate decreases (Fig.~\ref{fig:PE_fewerflash}) could be explored in much more detail with higher-resolution data like the TROPOMI data.
